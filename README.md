For this project we decided to make a VR application, using the Oculus Quest, which lets the user navigate through a maze, trying to find their way out, while fighting off enemies.  
The user can use voice commands such as shoot, reload and exit to achieve various tasks as well as flicking their wrist to reload.

This application was developed using Unity and Visual studio.  
The laguage used to develop the application was C#.  
To achieve voice control we used IBM Watson and for enemy sprites we used www.mixamo.com.
